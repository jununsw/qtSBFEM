% Normal Chan & Vese cannot work

% Chan & Vese for vector image works here
seg = chenvese(I,'large',300,0.02,'vector');
% Using built-in mask = 'whole' leads faster and better segmentation

%%
%-- Chan & Vese method for multiphase (Here I use only two phases)
% sigle phase can only distinguish two levels of objects 
% (background and foreground)in image
% two phases can distingush four levels of objects
% n phases can distinguish 2^n levels of objects
